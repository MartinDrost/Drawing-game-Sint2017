# Drawing-game-Sint2017

This is a multiplayer drawing game I created over a weekend. The project is created for the Dutch tradition "Sinterklaas" and is built using Angular5 and Node.js.

The application allows users to join a game in which they have to work together to draw a specific word. Players take turns and have a limited amount of ink per turn, the round is over if the current player runs out of ink.

Because of the limited timespan this project was created it has some flaws but it was a success nonetheless.
